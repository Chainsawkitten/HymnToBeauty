\page ComponentMesh Mesh

The %Mesh components adds a 3D model to an entity for rendering. It is preferred not to create mesh components directly, but to instead instantiate the scenes that are created automatically when importing a GLTF model.

For the mesh to be rendered, a %Material component is also necessary.
