\page ComponentMaterial Material

Defines the albedo, normal and roughness-metallic textures used when rendering. It is preferred not to create material components directly, but to instead instantiate the scenes that are created automatically when importing a GLTF model.

For the material to be rendered, a %Mesh component is also necessary.
