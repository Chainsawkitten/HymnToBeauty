Projects in Hymn to Beauty are called hymns.

\section CreateHymn Creating a hymn

Let's begin by opening the editor.

This is the editor of Hymn to Beauty. This is what you will use to create your hymns. But currently, there is no hymn open, so let's create one. You do that by clicking on the `File` menu and selecting `New Hymn`.

A dialog window will pop up, asking you to enter the name of the hymn. If you have already created a hymn, it will also show a list of all the existing hymns.

Enter a name, for example `MyFirstHymn`, and click on the `Create` button. This will create a new hymn with the given name and open it.

A number of things happened, such as a resource window popping up and more options being available in the menu bar at the top of the window. These will be covered in later sections. For now, let's save the hymn we just created.

\section SaveHymn Saving a hymn
Click on the `File` menu and select `Save Hymn`.

The hymn will now be saved. You can now close the editor.

A dialog window will pop up. It will show all of the available hymns.
