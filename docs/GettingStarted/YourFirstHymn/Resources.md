\section Navigating Navigating the resource list

The resource window shows the file structure of the project and all the resources in it. Folders have an arrow to the left of their name showing if they're expanded or collapsed.

Click on the arrow or the folder name to expand the folder and show its contents. By expanding the `Resources` folder, you can see that the hymn was created with a simple default scene called `Scene.scn`. This is currently the only resource in the hymn.
